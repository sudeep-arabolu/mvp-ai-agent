### Front‑end stub

This folder shows *only* the key React hook (`useChat.js`) that streams
Server‑Sent Events from the FastAPI `/ask` endpoint on port 5000.

In the full application this hook is imported into a functional
component, but the build and CSS boilerplate are omitted here because
the repo focuses on system design rather than UI polish.
